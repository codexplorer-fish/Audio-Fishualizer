This is a little project I am working on for learning purposes.

Features:

- Highly customizable presets

- Import and export presets

- File, mic, and tab inputs

- Option to animate in popup

Limitations:
- Completely untested on mobile
- Audio from tab sharing is unsupported on non-chromium browsers

To Do:
- Run multiple presets on top of each other
- Way more styles
