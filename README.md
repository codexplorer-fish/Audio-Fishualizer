A simple yet powerful audio visualizer hosted on GitHub Pages

This is a little project I am working on for learning purposes.

Features:

- Highly customizable presets

- File, mic, and tab inputs

- Animation in popup

Limitations:
- Completely untested on mobile
- Audio from tab sharing is unsupported on non-chromium browsers
- The error handling is nonexistent, causing the entire program to stop functioning if permissions are denied

To Do:
- Fix denied permissions handling
- Export and import presets
- About page for the site
- Prevent sleep checkbox
- Confirmation while deleting presets
- And last but not least: WAY MORE STYLES!
