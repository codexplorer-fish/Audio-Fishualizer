A simple online audio visualiser

This is a little project I am working on for learning purposes.

Features:

- Highly customizable presets

- File, mic, and tab inputs


To Do:
- Export and import presets
- About page for the site
- Prevent sleep checkbox
- Confirmation while deleting presets
- And last but not least:
    WAY MORE STYLES!
