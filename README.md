This is a little project I am working on for learning purposes.

Features:

- Highly customizable presets

- Import and export presets

- File, mic, and tab inputs

- Option to animate in popup

- Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Shift-Z

- Works on mobile (the built-in chrome emulator, at the very least)

- Timing offset for file sources for the perfect sync

Limitations:
- Limited keyboard-only support
- Audio from tab sharing is unsupported on non-chromium browsers and mobile browsers

To Do:
- Way more styles!
- Image pipeline as a style type too
- Run multiple presets on top of each other (this will take a long time)
